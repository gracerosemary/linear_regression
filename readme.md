PR Link: https://github.com/gracerosemary/linear_regression/pull/1

**Author**: Grace Choi  
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
Using cigarette data set to perform exploratory analysis.

## Getting Started
Download data sets, create repo, solve and answer questions, clean notebook

## Architecture
Poetry, Jupyter, Pandas, SKLearn

## 3 Conclusions:
1. While cigarettes that have more tar are more likely to have more carbon monoxide output, accuracy prediction is only at 67%.   
2. Discrepancies appear to widen when the tar amount is over 15 mg.  
3. The cigarette with the highest tar amount (~20mg) is not directly correlated with the cigarette with the highest CO emmission (~22 mg).
